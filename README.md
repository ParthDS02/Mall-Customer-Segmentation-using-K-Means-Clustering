## ðŸ“ˆ **Data Visualizations & Observations**
### **1. Distribution of Annual Income**
ðŸ“Œ *Observation:*  
- The distribution of annual income is **right-skewed**, meaning fewer customers have extremely high incomes.  
- Most customers earn between **40k$ and 80k$**, with a peak around **60k$**, indicating a middle-income customer base.

---

### **2. Distribution of Age**
ðŸ“Œ *Observation:*  
- The majority of customers fall between **25 to 40 years old**, with the peak around **30 years**, suggesting a younger customer base.  
- Very few customers are aged **above 60**, indicating that businesses targeting senior citizens might need a different approach.

---

### **3. Distribution of Spending Score**
ðŸ“Œ *Observation:*  
- The spending scores range from **0 to 100**, with most customers scoring between **40 and 60**, indicating a mix of moderate spenders.  
- The distribution is slightly **bimodal**, meaning there are two dominant spending groupsâ€”moderate spenders and high spenders.

---

### **4. Elbow Method (WCSS vs K for 2D Clustering)**
ðŸ“Œ *Observation:*  
- The **elbow point appears at K=5**, meaning five clusters provide an optimal segmentation of customers.

### **5. 2D Customer Segmentation (Annual Income vs Spending Score)**
ðŸ“Œ *Observation:*  
- The scatter plot reveals five well-defined clusters, separating customers based on income and spending patterns.  
- **High-income, high-spending customers (black cluster)** are premium buyers who may respond well to luxury and exclusive offers.

### **6. Elbow Method (WCSS vs K for 3D Clustering)**
ðŸ“Œ *Observation:*  
- The **optimal number of clusters remains at K=5**, even when age is introduced as an additional dimension.

### **7. 3D Customer Segmentation (Age, Income, Spending Score)**
ðŸ“Œ *Observation:*  
- The **yellow and red clusters (high spenders) tend to be younger**, suggesting that youth-oriented marketing strategies may be effective.

## âœ… **Final Results & Insights**
- **Five customer segments identified**:  
  - **Low-income, low-spenders** â€“ Price-sensitive, require discounts.  
  - **Low-income, high-spenders** â€“ Impulsive buyers, engaged customers.  
  - **High-income, low-spenders** â€“ Untapped potential, need personalized promotions.  
  - **High-income, high-spenders** â€“ Premium buyers, ideal for VIP programs.  
  - **Moderate-income, balanced-spenders** â€“ Frequent shoppers, best for loyalty programs.  

- **Elbow Method confirms that 5 clusters are optimal** for segmentation.  
- **Businesses can use these insights** to tailor marketing strategies and optimize customer experience.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Future Scope**
- Implement **Hierarchical Clustering** to compare segmentation effectiveness.  
- Integrate **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** for better customer profiling.  
- Develop a **real-time recommendation system** based on customer segments.
