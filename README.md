# **Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**
  
## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**
Understanding customer behavior is essential for **targeted marketing and business growth**. This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on **annual income, spending score, and age**. By identifying **distinct customer groups**, businesses can design **personalized marketing strategies**, optimize **customer engagement**, and improve **revenue generation**.  

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why This Project?**
- Customer segmentation is a **critical component** of data-driven decision-making for businesses.  
- Helps businesses **identify high-value customers** and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.  
- Enables companies to **increase customer retention, optimize promotions, and drive sales growth**.  

## ðŸ”¥ **Industry Applications**
1. **Targeted Marketing & Personalized Promotions**  
   - Identifies high-value customers for **exclusive discounts, rewards, and offers**.  
   - Engages price-sensitive customers with **budget-friendly promotions**.  

2. **Optimized Store Layout & Inventory Management**  
   - **Improves product placement** based on customer segmentation.  
   - Helps **predict product demand** to prevent overstock and shortages.  

3. **Enhancing Customer Experience & Retention**  
   - Retains premium customers through **VIP programs & loyalty incentives**.  
   - Re-engages **low-spending customers** with personalized marketing strategies.  

## ðŸš€ **Technologies Used**
- **Google Colab** â€“ For coding, data analysis, and visualization.  
- **Overleaf** â€“ For generating professional PDF reports using LaTeX.  

## ðŸ“š **Libraries Used**
- **pandas** â€“ For data manipulation.  
- **numpy** â€“ For numerical computations.  
- **matplotlib & seaborn** â€“ For data visualization.  
- **scikit-learn** â€“ For implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm.  

## ðŸ“Š **Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Load and clean customer data.  
   - Handle missing values and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).  

2. **Feature Selection**  
   - Consider **Annual Income, Spending Score, and Age** for clustering.  

3. **Clustering Using K-Means**  
   - Determine the **optimal number of clusters** using the **Elbow Method**.  
   - Apply **K-Means clustering** to segment customers.  

4. **Result Visualization**  
   - **2D Scatter Plot**: Customer segmentation based on **Annual Income & Spending Score**.  
   - **3D Visualization**: Customer segmentation based on **Age, Income & Spending Score**.  

## âœ… **Final Results & Insights**
- **Five customer segments identified**:  
  - **Low-income, low-spenders** â€“ Price-sensitive, require discounts.  
  - **Low-income, high-spenders** â€“ Impulsive buyers, engaged customers.  
  - **High-income, low-spenders** â€“ Untapped potential, need personalized promotions.  
  - **High-income, high-spenders** â€“ Premium buyers, ideal for VIP programs.  
  - **Moderate-income, balanced-spenders** â€“ Frequent shoppers, best for loyalty programs.  

- **Elbow Method confirms that 5 clusters are optimal** for segmentation.  
- **Businesses can use these insights** to tailor marketing strategies and optimize customer experience.  

## ðŸŽ¯ **Future Scope**
- Implement **Hierarchical Clustering** to compare segmentation effectiveness.  
- Integrate **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** for better customer profiling.
